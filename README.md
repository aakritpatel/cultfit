After a month with Cult, I’ve discovered a love for swimming and fitness—transforming from inactive to actively pursuing health. This blog shares suggestions I believe will benefit both me and fellow Cult users.

The complete blog post with details of all the recommendations are available here:

This repo contains the following project(s):

Weight loss timelapse - This contains:
  - download_images.py - a file to take a list of s3 images and then download them
  - face_detection.py - a file to resize and reframe all images received from the first action, such that the resolution of all output images is the same and the face is centered in them
  - timelapse_video.py - a file to create a timelapse video using all the resized and reframed images, with an option to define view_time_per_image
